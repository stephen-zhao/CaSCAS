# CaSCAS #
It stands for Canadian Students' Computer Algebra System.

CaSCAS is *currently* a built-from-scratch Python library and standalone tool for working with algebraic formulas. Right now it is able to parse standard human-readable math expressions, and simplify trivial items. Eventually, it will be able to do full-fledged simplifications, computations, evaluation of functions, differentiation, and factoring.
